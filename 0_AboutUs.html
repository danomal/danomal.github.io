		<h3>History</h3>
		<hr>
        <p>100+ Women Who Care--Naperville, began in February, 2009 with 29 members. The goal was to reach 
			a membership of 100, which was reached and surpassed in the spring of 2013. Today the membership 
			numbers over 140, more than four times what it was at that first meeting in 2009. Since we first 
			met in 2009, we have donated $715,941 to local charities.
			<br>
			<br>
			The first 100 Women Who Care chapter was founded in 2006 by Karen Dunigan in Jackson, MI. 
			Since then, other chapters have been launched throughout the U.S. and in other countries as well.
			The Naperville chapte began in February, 2009 with 29 members. 
			The goal was to reach a membership of 100, whichwas reached and surpassed in the spring
			of 2013. Today the membership numbers over 140, more than four times what it was at that first meeting in 2009.</p>

			<li>Sign up to learn more!</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How it Works</h3>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li>We meet 4 times a year--in Feb., May, Aug., and Nov.--on the 3rd Tuesday of the month. </li>
			
			<li>At each meeting, three organizations, charities, nonprofits are nominated by members  of 100+ Women Who Care. Only local organizations with 501(c)3 (tax deductible) status are nominated. 
				Each of the three nominating members is then allowed time to present information about the 
				organization she has nominated and explain why she believes it is worthy of our
				donations.  Other members in attendance then ask whatever questions they may have.  </li>
				
			<li>By secret ballot, each member then votes for the organization to which she believes we should   donate.  
				Ballots are then counted and the organization to which we will donate is chosen by plurality.</li>
				
			<li>Each member will then donate $100 to the chosen organization, either by check or online.</li>
			
			<li>After all donations are collected, members of 100+ Women Who Care present the donations to the   directors of the chosen organization.  Those directors must agree not to share names or other  
				information about any of the individual women in 100+ WWC.</li>
			<li>And the best part is the knowledge that you are part of a circle of women who--like you-want to make a difference and actually do so.</li>
		</ul>
